# **Project**

## Objective
As a food lover, I created this app to provide a community-driven platform where food enthusiasts can explore, share, and interact with recipes from various cuisines around the world. By facilitating a space for users to post recipes, rate dishes, leave comments, and offer feedback.

## Site Users Goal
The goal of the users is to discover a variety of recipes to try at home, ranging from everyday meals to special dishes from around the world.

## Site Owners Goal
The goal of the site owner of TastyYum is to ensure the platform's growth, user satisfaction, and overall success by encouraging active participation through recipe sharing, commenting, and voting.

### Database Schema
The database model used for this project is shown below and it was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/)

#### ðŸ‘¤ User Stories
1. As a user, I want to easily browse or search for dishes based on cuisine, dietary preferences, or ingredients, so that I can quickly find recipes that suit my tastes or dietary needs.
2. As a user, I want to leave comments on recipes, so that I can ask questions, share tips, or leave feedback for other users.
3. As a user, I want to be able to browse recipes and read instructions without needing to log in, so that I can get a feel for the site before registering.
4. As a user, I want to find recipes that can be made quickly, so that I can prepare meals efficiently within my time constraints.
5. As a user, I want to quickly scan recipes on the list page and see brief descriptions or ratings, so that I can decide which recipe interests me most before clicking through.
6. As a user accessing the site from my phone, I want the interface to be fully responsive, so that I can comfortably browse and read recipes on a smaller screen.
7. As an owner looking to grow the platform, I want analytics on recipe views, user engagement, and popular content, so that I can make data-driven decisions to improve the site.
8. As an admin, I want the ability to moderate user-generated content, so that I can ensure recipes and comments meet quality and community guidelines.

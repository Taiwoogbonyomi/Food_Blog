# **Project**

## Objective
As a food lover, I created this app to provide a community-driven platform where food enthusiasts can explore, share, and interact with recipes from various cuisines around the world. By facilitating a space for users to post recipes, rate dishes, leave comments, and offer feedback.

## Site Users Goal
The goal of the users is to discover a variety of recipes to try at home, ranging from everyday meals to special dishes from around the world.

## Site Owners Goal
The goal of the site owner of TastyYum is to ensure the platform's growth, user satisfaction, and overall success by encouraging active participation through recipe sharing, commenting, and voting.

### Database Schema
The database model used for this project is shown below and it was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/)
